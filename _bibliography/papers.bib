  abstract={Wireless-powered Internet of Things (IoT) systems allow small IoT devices to operate without accompanying dedicated power sources. A well-known protocol for such networks utilizes the harvest and then transmit concept which involves wireless energy transfer (WET) followed by wireless information transfer (WIT). We formulate two optimization problems for wireless-powered IoT systems to maximize the weighted sum-rate for time-division multiple access (TDMA) and nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) by optimizing the harvesting time and transmission time variables. First, we derive semi-closed form solutions, which achieve the global optimum, for these two problems. The proposed approach is highly computationally efficient for large IoT networks. We prove that the scalar equations in both TDMA and NOMA maintain a unique solution which can be found via bisection. It is revealed that when the device’s circuit power consumption is negligible, NOMA outperforms TDMA. However, when devices consume large circuit power, TDMA is more efficient than NOMA. Numerical results determine a critical point where NOMA surpasses TDMA in weighted sum-rate if plotted versus WET transmit power. The critical point depends on the WET power, device’s circuit power consumption, conversion efficiency and saturation level of the (non)linear energy harvester, and finally the number of devices and their associated weights.},

  abstract={One of the major challenges with cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks is providing backhaul links for a large number of distributed access points (APs). In general, providing fiber optics backhaul for these APs is not cost-effective and also reduces network scalability. Wireless backhauling is a promising solution that can be integrated with wireless access links to increase spectrum efficiency. In this paper, the application of integrated access and backhaul (IAB) technique in millimeter-wave (mmWave) CF massive MIMO systems is investigated. The access and backhaul links share a frequency spectrum in the mmWave bands, and in both, hybrid beamforming techniques are adopted for signal transmission. The bandwidth allocation (division) parameter between the two link types as well as the beamforming matrices are optimized to maximize the end-to-end data rate. This leads to a non-convex optimization problem for which an efficient solution method is proposed. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the IAB technique and our proposed scheme in CF massive MIMO systems. These simulations also compare the proposed hybrid beamforming method with a fully digital solution in terms of the number of radio frequency (RF) chains and the volume of backhaul traffic. Finally, the effect of increasing the number of APs on the users’ data rates in terms of wireless access and backhaul links constraints is also examined.},

  abstract={The problem of access point (AP) to device association in a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is investigated. Utilizing energy efficiency (EE) as our main metric, we determine the optimal association parameters subject to minimum rate constraints for all devices. We incorporate all existing practical concerns in our formulation, including training errors, pilot contamination, and central processing unit access to only statistical channel state information (CSI). This EE maximization problem is highly non-convex and possibly NP-hard. We propose to solve this challenging problem by model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods. Due to the very large discrete action space of our posed optimization problem, existing DRL approaches can not be directly applied. Thus, we approximate the large discrete action space with either a continuous set or a smaller discrete set, and modify existing DRL methods accordingly. Our novel approximations offer a framework with tolerable complexity and satisfactory performance that can be readily applied to other challenging optimization problems in wireless communication. Simulation results corroborate the superior performance of the modified DRL methods over conventional approaches.},

  abstract={In this paper, we tackle the problem of optimizing user clustering, power, and resource (time slot or bandwidth) allocation in the downlink of a hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-orthogonal multiple access (OMA) system. In such a system, users are organized into several clusters under one of the following scenarios: (1) fixed cluster size, (2) fixed number of clusters, and (3) variable number of clusters and variable cluster size. A power domain NOMA (PD-NOMA) scheme is used in each cluster, while OMA is employed for allocating resources to different clusters. The goal is to maximize the minimum success probability (which is equivalent to minimizing the maximum outage probability) among all users to guarantee fairness. We prove that at the optimal solution, all users have the same success probability, which is called the common success probability (CSP). Then, we propose an efficient algorithm for finding the optimal CSP and cluster resource allocation factors simultaneously. The optimal power allocation factors and the optimal decoding order of users in each cluster are then derived in closed-form expressions based on the obtained optimal CSP. Simulation results show considerable performance gains by the proposed scheme, compared to existing schemes in terms of fairness, the minimum success probability of users, and the sum throughput.},

  abstract={We study the secrecy rate maximization problem in a millimeter wave (mmWave) network, consisting of a base station (BS), multiple intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) (or reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)), multiple users, and a single eavesdropper. To ensure a fair secrecy rate among all the users, we adopt a max-min fairness criterion which results in a mixed integer problem. We first relax discrete IRSs phase shifts to the continuous ones. To cope with the non-convexity of the relaxed optimization problem, we leverage the penalty method and block coordinate descent approach to divide it into two sub-problems, which are solved by successive convex approximation (SCA). Then, we propose a low-complexity mapping algorithm where feasible IRSs phase shifts are obtained. Mathematical evaluation shows the convergence of sub-problems to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the original ones. Furthermore, the convergence guarantee of the overall proposed algorithm and computational complexity are investigated. Finally, simulation results show our proposed algorithm outweighs the conventional solutions based on the semi-definite programming (SDP) in terms of convergence and secrecy rate, especially in a larger number of IRSs and phase shifts where SDP suffers from rank-one approximation. Maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and IRS-free systems are also considered as other benchmarks.},

  abstract={In this paper, we investigate joint optimization of power allocation factors (PAFs) and decoding order of users in the downlink of a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system over Nakagami- m fading channels. The objective is to guarantee fairness among the users in terms of outage probability (or its complement success probability). To this end, we maximize the minimum success probability (Max-MSP) among the users when only statistical channel state information (CSI) is available at the transmitter side. We solve such a problem by first proving that at the optimal solution, all the users have a common success probability (CSP), and then proposing an efficient algorithm for finding CSP of the users. The optimal PAFs and optimal decoding order are derived in closed form based on the CSP and statistical CSI of the users. It is proved that the proposed algorithm always converges to a unique optimal solution. Furthermore, we show that in contrast to Rayleigh fading channels, in Nakagami- m fading channels, the optimal decoding order not only depends on the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of each user but also depends on the variance of the SNR and data rate of that user.},

  abstract={This paper is on the spectral efficiency (SE) of a dense multi-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). The channels are spatially correlated and the multi-slope path loss model is considered. In our framework, the channel state information is obtained by using pilot sequences and the BSs are deployed randomly. First, we study the channel estimation accuracy and its impact on the SE as the BS density increases and the network becomes densified. Second, we consider the special case of uncorrelated channels for which the stochastic geometry framework helps us to simplify the SE expressions, and obtain the minimum value of antenna-UE ratio over which the pilot contamination is dominant rather than the inter- and intra-cell interference. Finally, we provide some insights into the obtained SE for the spatially correlated channels, from a multi-cell processing scheme as well as the single-cell ones in terms of the BS density. Our results show that while all the detectors result in non-increasing SE in terms of the BS density, their area SE increases exponentially as the network becomes densified. Moreover, we conclude that in order to achieve a given SE, the required value of antenna-UE ratio decreases as the level of channel correlation increases.},

  pages={150514-150526},
  abstract={In this article, downlink secure transmission in simultaneous information and power transfer (SWIPT) system enabled with massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is studied. A base station (BS) with a large number of antennas transmits energy and information signals to its intended users, but these signals are also received by an active eavesdropper. The users and eavesdropper employ a power splitting technique to simultaneously decode information and harvest energy. Massive MIMO helps the BS to focus energy to the users and prevent information leakage to the eavesdropper. The harvested energy by each user is employed for decoding information and transmitting uplink pilot signals for channel estimation. It is assumed that the active eavesdropper also harvests energy in the downlink and then contributes during the uplink training phase. Achievable secrecy rate is considered as the performance criterion and a closed-form lower bound for it is derived. To provide secure transmission, the achievable secrecy rate is then maximized through an optimization problem with constraints on the minimum harvested energy by the user and the maximum harvested energy by the eavesdropper. Numerical results show the effectiveness of using massive MIMO in providing physical layer security in SWIPT systems and also show that our closed-form expressions for the secrecy rate are accurate.},
