  abstract={Wireless-powered Internet of Things (IoT) systems allow small IoT devices to operate without accompanying dedicated power sources. A well-known protocol for such networks utilizes the harvest and then transmit concept which involves wireless energy transfer (WET) followed by wireless information transfer (WIT). We formulate two optimization problems for wireless-powered IoT systems to maximize the weighted sum-rate for time-division multiple access (TDMA) and nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) by optimizing the harvesting time and transmission time variables. First, we derive semi-closed form solutions, which achieve the global optimum, for these two problems. The proposed approach is highly computationally efficient for large IoT networks. We prove that the scalar equations in both TDMA and NOMA maintain a unique solution which can be found via bisection. It is revealed that when the device’s circuit power consumption is negligible, NOMA outperforms TDMA. However, when devices consume large circuit power, TDMA is more efficient than NOMA. Numerical results determine a critical point where NOMA surpasses TDMA in weighted sum-rate if plotted versus WET transmit power. The critical point depends on the WET power, device’s circuit power consumption, conversion efficiency and saturation level of the (non)linear energy harvester, and finally the number of devices and their associated weights.},

  abstract={In this paper, we explore the problem of utilizing Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) technology in Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), with a particular focus on aerial access networks. We consider an Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based wireless network comprised of two layers of UAVs: (a) a lower layer consisting a number of flying users and a UAV Base Station (BS) that provides coverage for terrestrial users and, (b) an upper layer designated to provide both wireless access for flying users and backhaul connectivity for UAV BS. By adopting IAB technology, the backhaul and access links collaboratively share their resources, enabling aerial backhauling and the utilization of the same infrastructure and frequency resources for access links. A sum-rate maximization problem is formulated by considering aerial backhaul constraints to optimally allocate the frequency spectrum between aerial and terrestrial networks. We decompose the resulting non-convex optimization problem into two sub-problems of beamforming and spectrum allocation and then propose efficient solutions for each. Numerical results in different scenarios yield insightful findings about the effectiveness of using the IAB technique in aerial networks.},

  pages={71658-71667},
  abstract={One of the major challenges with cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks is providing backhaul links for a large number of distributed access points (APs). In general, providing fiber optics backhaul for these APs is not cost-effective and also reduces network scalability. Wireless backhauling is a promising solution that can be integrated with wireless access links to increase spectrum efficiency. In this paper, the application of integrated access and backhaul (IAB) technique in millimeter-wave (mmWave) CF massive MIMO systems is investigated. The access and backhaul links share a frequency spectrum in the mmWave bands, and in both, hybrid beamforming techniques are adopted for signal transmission. The bandwidth allocation (division) parameter between the two link types as well as the beamforming matrices are optimized to maximize the end-to-end data rate. This leads to a non-convex optimization problem for which an efficient solution method is proposed. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the IAB technique and our proposed scheme in CF massive MIMO systems. These simulations also compare the proposed hybrid beamforming method with a fully digital solution in terms of the number of radio frequency (RF) chains and the volume of backhaul traffic. Finally, the effect of increasing the number of APs on the users’ data rates in terms of wireless access and backhaul links constraints is also examined.},

  abstract={The problem of access point (AP) to device association in a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is investigated. Utilizing energy efficiency (EE) as our main metric, we determine the optimal association parameters subject to minimum rate constraints for all devices. We incorporate all existing practical concerns in our formulation, including training errors, pilot contamination, and central processing unit access to only statistical channel state information (CSI). This EE maximization problem is highly non-convex and possibly NP-hard. We propose to solve this challenging problem by model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods. Due to the very large discrete action space of our posed optimization problem, existing DRL approaches can not be directly applied. Thus, we approximate the large discrete action space with either a continuous set or a smaller discrete set, and modify existing DRL methods accordingly. Our novel approximations offer a framework with tolerable complexity and satisfactory performance that can be readily applied to other challenging optimization problems in wireless communication. Simulation results corroborate the superior performance of the modified DRL methods over conventional approaches.},

  abstract={In this paper, we tackle the problem of optimizing user clustering, power, and resource (time slot or bandwidth) allocation in the downlink of a hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-orthogonal multiple access (OMA) system. In such a system, users are organized into several clusters under one of the following scenarios: (1) fixed cluster size, (2) fixed number of clusters, and (3) variable number of clusters and variable cluster size. A power domain NOMA (PD-NOMA) scheme is used in each cluster, while OMA is employed for allocating resources to different clusters. The goal is to maximize the minimum success probability (which is equivalent to minimizing the maximum outage probability) among all users to guarantee fairness. We prove that at the optimal solution, all users have the same success probability, which is called the common success probability (CSP). Then, we propose an efficient algorithm for finding the optimal CSP and cluster resource allocation factors simultaneously. The optimal power allocation factors and the optimal decoding order of users in each cluster are then derived in closed-form expressions based on the obtained optimal CSP. Simulation results show considerable performance gains by the proposed scheme, compared to existing schemes in terms of fairness, the minimum success probability of users, and the sum throughput.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the optimum power allocation ratio of a jammer in order to ruin the sum spectral efficiency (SSE) of a user-centric cell-free network. In this regard, signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) is initially derived for each user in uplink, and then, a closed-form expression for SSE is provided. An optimization problem has been solved for two scenarios which finds the optimum power allocation that minimizes the SSE of the network, first for a single antenna jammer and next for a multi-antenna one. Additionally, the performance of the SSE has been studied in the presence of several single-antenna jammers in the proposed network and also one multi-antenna jammer. The result is compared with co-located multi-input multi-output (MIMO) network and it is found that unlike co-located MIMO, as the number of serving access points (APs) increases, the network becomes more robust against jamming. The effect of the jammer’s antenna on power allocation ratio and spectral efficiency is further presented. Moreover, the impact of the number of jammers and the number of serving APs on the SE has been surveyed.},

  abstract={We study the secrecy rate maximization problem in a millimeter wave (mmWave) network, consisting of a base station (BS), multiple intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) (or reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)), multiple users, and a single eavesdropper. To ensure a fair secrecy rate among all the users, we adopt a max-min fairness criterion which results in a mixed integer problem. We first relax discrete IRSs phase shifts to the continuous ones. To cope with the non-convexity of the relaxed optimization problem, we leverage the penalty method and block coordinate descent approach to divide it into two sub-problems, which are solved by successive convex approximation (SCA). Then, we propose a low-complexity mapping algorithm where feasible IRSs phase shifts are obtained. Mathematical evaluation shows the convergence of sub-problems to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the original ones. Furthermore, the convergence guarantee of the overall proposed algorithm and computational complexity are investigated. Finally, simulation results show our proposed algorithm outweighs the conventional solutions based on the semi-definite programming (SDP) in terms of convergence and secrecy rate, especially in a larger number of IRSs and phase shifts where SDP suffers from rank-one approximation. Maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and IRS-free systems are also considered as other benchmarks.},

  abstract={In this paper, we investigate joint optimization of power allocation factors (PAFs) and decoding order of users in the downlink of a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system over Nakagami- m fading channels. The objective is to guarantee fairness among the users in terms of outage probability (or its complement success probability). To this end, we maximize the minimum success probability (Max-MSP) among the users when only statistical channel state information (CSI) is available at the transmitter side. We solve such a problem by first proving that at the optimal solution, all the users have a common success probability (CSP), and then proposing an efficient algorithm for finding CSP of the users. The optimal PAFs and optimal decoding order are derived in closed form based on the CSP and statistical CSI of the users. It is proved that the proposed algorithm always converges to a unique optimal solution. Furthermore, we show that in contrast to Rayleigh fading channels, in Nakagami- m fading channels, the optimal decoding order not only depends on the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of each user but also depends on the variance of the SNR and data rate of that user.},

  abstract={This paper is on the spectral efficiency (SE) of a dense multi-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). The channels are spatially correlated and the multi-slope path loss model is considered. In our framework, the channel state information is obtained by using pilot sequences and the BSs are deployed randomly. First, we study the channel estimation accuracy and its impact on the SE as the BS density increases and the network becomes densified. Second, we consider the special case of uncorrelated channels for which the stochastic geometry framework helps us to simplify the SE expressions, and obtain the minimum value of antenna-UE ratio over which the pilot contamination is dominant rather than the inter- and intra-cell interference. Finally, we provide some insights into the obtained SE for the spatially correlated channels, from a multi-cell processing scheme as well as the single-cell ones in terms of the BS density. Our results show that while all the detectors result in non-increasing SE in terms of the BS density, their area SE increases exponentially as the network becomes densified. Moreover, we conclude that in order to achieve a given SE, the required value of antenna-UE ratio decreases as the level of channel correlation increases.},

  abstract={Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MaMIMO) and cognitive radio networks (CRNs) are two promising technologies for improving spectral efficiency of next-generation wireless communication networks. In this paper, we investigate the problem of physical layer security in the networks that jointly use both technologies, named MaMIMO-CRN. Specifically, to investigate the vulnerability of this network, we design an optimized attacking scenario to MaMIMO-CRNs by a jammer. For having the most adversary effect on the uplink transmission of the legitimate MaMIMO-CRN, we propose an efficient method for power allocation of the jammer. The legitimate network consists of a training and a data transmission phase, and both of these phases are attacked by the jammer using an optimized power split between them. The resulting power allocation problem is non-convex. We thus propose three different efficient methods for solving this problem, and we show that under some assumptions, a closed-form solution can also be obtained. Our results show the vulnerability of the MaMIMO-CRN to an optimized jammer. It is also shown that increasing the number of antennas at the legitimate network does not improve the security of the network.},

  abstract={The problem of adaptive modulation with outdated channel state information (CSI) is considered. Best existing approach to tackle this problem relies on using a (non-)linear auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) model to predict current CSI from outdated values. This approach is valid only if the wireless channel variations over time behave in a linear or smooth enough nonlinear fashion, which is not necessarily the case. We propose a deep reinforcement learning based adaptive modulation (DRL-AM) approach that can handle this limitation. While DRL-AM is more complex than (non-)linear AR(MA), it performs significantly better as corroborated via numerical results on real channel measurements. Furthermore, compared to capacity-achieving codes, complexity is moved from receiver to transmitter making this approach suitable for receiving nodes with limited resources such as internet of things (IoT) devices.},

  abstract={In this article, downlink secure transmission in simultaneous information and power transfer (SWIPT) system enabled with massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is studied. A base station (BS) with a large number of antennas transmits energy and information signals to its intended users, but these signals are also received by an active eavesdropper. The users and eavesdropper employ a power splitting technique to simultaneously decode information and harvest energy. Massive MIMO helps the BS to focus energy to the users and prevent information leakage to the eavesdropper. The harvested energy by each user is employed for decoding information and transmitting uplink pilot signals for channel estimation. It is assumed that the active eavesdropper also harvests energy in the downlink and then contributes during the uplink training phase. Achievable secrecy rate is considered as the performance criterion and a closed-form lower bound for it is derived. To provide secure transmission, the achievable secrecy rate is then maximized through an optimization problem with constraints on the minimum harvested energy by the user and the maximum harvested energy by the eavesdropper. Numerical results show the effectiveness of using massive MIMO in providing physical layer security in SWIPT systems and also show that our closed-form expressions for the secrecy rate are accurate.},

  abstract={In this paper, we consider how the uplink transmission of a spatially correlated massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system can be protected from a jamming attack. To suppress the jamming, we propose a novel framework including a new optimal linear estimator in the training phase and a bilinear equalizer in the data phase. The proposed estimator is optimal in the sense of maximizing the spectral efficiency of the legitimate system attacked by a jammer, and its implementation needs the statistical knowledge about the jammer's channel. We derive an efficient algorithm to estimate the jamming information needed for implementation of the proposed framework. Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimized power allocation at the legitimate users can improve the performance of the proposed framework regardless of the jamming power optimization. Our proposed framework can be exploited to combat jamming in scenarios with either ideal or non-ideal hardware at the legitimate users and the jammer. Numerical results reveal that using the proposed framework, the jammer cannot dramatically affect the performance of the legitimate system.},

  abstract={Frequency division duplex (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems introduce a large overhead in downlink channel estimation in contrast to the time division duplex (TDD) mode. This overhead results in a considerable spectral efficiency (SE) gap between the FDD and TDD modes. In this paper, we consider the performance of the TDD and FDD massive MIMO systems with a spatially correlated channel in the presence of jamming in the network. We show how a smart jammer can effectively design its attack signal to degrade the network performance in terms of the downlink SE. Since the jammer can obtain different information about the channels in the TDD and FDD modes, two distinct jamming strategies are proposed for each mode. In the numerical results, the performance of both the TDD and FDD modes under the optimized jamming designs are evaluated and compared. Our results show that despite more attention to the TDD mode in current massive MIMO systems, it is more vulnerable to smart jamming attacks compared to the FDD mode which results in a smaller SE-gap between the modes. Furthermore, a countermeasure technique is proposed to combat this jamming attack in both the TDD and FDD modes by estimating the jamming power, grouping users, and allocating power among them. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed countermeasure techniques in both the TDD and FDD modes.},

  abstract={The integration of high-rate internet of things (IoT) service into a massive MIMO network is considered. Existing approaches are limited in several ways: i) they incur large overhead for high data rates, ii) they do not consider channel aging explicitly, iii) channel tracking is performed for one device only treating others as noise, iv) pilot access patterns are assumed known at base station (BS) severely limiting network flexibility. Here, several algorithms are proposed that circumvent all of the aforementioned shortcomings with modest complexity. Specifically, ideas from target tracking literature is leveraged to model each unknown pilot contamination pattern as a different target-measurement association. Subsequently, several algorithms based on probabilistic data association filter (PDAF), multiple hypotheses tracking (MHT), global nearest neighbor (GNN), and soft and hard least-squares (LS) are presented. By numerical analysis, it is determined that their performance comes surprisingly close to that of the optimum tracker which knows access patterns when number of BS antennas are large.},

  abstract={In this paper, we address the problem of 3D beamforming (3DBF) in millimeter wave (mmWave) wireless networks. In particular, we study the impact of base station (BS) antenna tilt angle optimization on the energy efficiency (EE) of mmWave networks under two different scenarios: a homogeneous network consisting of multiple macro base stations (MBSs), and a heterogeneous network where several femto base stations are added within the coverage areas of the MBSs. First, by adopting a stochastic geometry approach, we analyze the coverage probability of both scenarios that incorporate 3DBF. Then, we derive the EE of the networks as a function of the MBS antenna tilt angle. Next, optimization problems are formulated to maximize the EE of the networks by optimizing the tilt angle. Since the computational complexity of the optimal solution is very high, near-optimal low-complexity methods are proposed for solving the optimization problems. Simulation results show that in the mmWave networks, the 3DBF technique with optimized tilt angle can considerably improve the EE of the network. Also, the proposed low complexity approach presents a performance close to the optimal solution but with a significant reduced complexity.},

  abstract={Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) or Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) are metasurfaces that can be deployed in various places in wireless environments to make these environments controllable and reconfigurable. In this paper, we investigate the problem of using 3D beamforming in RISempowered wireless networks and propose a new scheme that provides more degrees of freedom in designing and deploying the RIS-based networks. In the proposed scheme, a base station (BS) equipped with a full dimensional array of antennas optimizes its radiation pattern in the three dimensional space to maximize the received signal to noise ratio at a target user. We also study the effect of angle of incidence of the received signal by the RIS on its reflecting properties and find a relation between this angle and the BS antenna array’s tilt and elevation angles. The user receives the signal from a reflected path from the RIS as well as from a direct path from the BS which both depend on the BS antenna array’s tilt and elevation angles. These angles and also the RIS element’s phase shifts are jointly numerically optimized. Our simulation results show that using RIS-assisted 3D beamforming with optimized phase shifts and radiation angles can considerably improve the performance of wireless networks.},

  abstract={In this brief, we propose a framework for protecting the uplink transmission of a massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system from a jamming attack. Our framework includes a novel minimum mean-squared error-based jamming suppression (MMSE-JS) estimator for channel training and a linear zero-forcing jamming suppression (ZFJS) detector for uplink combining. The MMSE-JS exploits some intentionally unused pilots to reduce the pilot contamination caused by the jammer. The ZFJS suppresses the jamming interference during the detection of the legitimate users' data symbols. The proposed framework is implementable, since the complexities of computing the MMSE-JS and the ZFJS are linear (not exponential) with respect to the number of antennas at the base station and can be fabricated using 28-nm fully depleted silicon on insulator technology and for the mMIMO systems. Our analysis shows that the jammer cannot dramatically affect the performance of an mMIMO system equipped with the combination of MMSE-JS and ZFJS. Numerical results confirm our analysis.},

  abstract={In this paper, we study the effect of users' height distribution on the coverage probability of millimeter-wave (mmWave) cellular networks that utilize three-dimensional beamforming (3DBF). The users and base stations (BSs) are equipped with multiple antennas and both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS links exist in the channel which are, respectively, modeled by the Nakagami-m and Rayleigh distribution. In this setup, we investigate the tilt angle optimization of the BS antenna arrays for maximizing the coverage probability under two regimes of noise limited and interference limited. In both cases, by adopting a stochastic geometry approach, we analytically derive the coverage probability, and then, find the optimal tilt angle that maximizes this probability. In addition, in the noise limited regime, we show that the optimal tilt angle depends on the average distance between each user and its serving BS and also their effective height. In the interference-limited regime, we further consider different rules for associating users to the BSs. Meanwhile, since in this regime, the tilt angle optimization is very complex, we propose a low complexity approach to find the optimal tilt angle that has a performance close to the optimal solution. We further study the asymptotic behavior when the density of the BSs or signal-to-interference ratio tends to infinity or zero. Finally, through the numerical simulations, we show that using the 3DBF and also incorporating the users' height distribution in the tilt angle optimization lead to a substantial improvement in the coverage probability of the mmWave cellular networks.},
